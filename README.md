This repository demonstrates [ML.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet) being applied to a **binary classification** problem: predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews. 

## To Get Started

1) Get the data! It's available on kaggle here: [https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews](imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)

2) Put the data in the Data folder and change the name of the CSV file to: *imdbdataset.csv* (or change the code so that it works with the original file name).

3) Open up the solution and run the project!
